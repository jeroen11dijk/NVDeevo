# NVDerevo
My amazing RLBot Derevo.

If you really wanna run this bot, you have to add the RLU pyd files to the RLU folder. You can download it [here](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities/releases/download/v1.0.2/rlutilities_1_0_2.zip).

Watch Derevo and other bots play at ``my`` this [amazing youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf0DU-WXikHHieWsAp6H9mw).

It also has some replays uploaded to calculated.gg which you can check out [here](https://calculated.gg/players/b2e31bfa00b).
