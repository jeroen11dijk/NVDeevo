# NV Derevo

The cpp version of NV Derevo, the python one can be found [here](https://github.com/jeroen11dijk/NVDerevo)

It uses a slightly edited and trimmed version of [RLUtilities by chip](https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities).

To compile it, you need CMake and a C++ compiler (Visual Studio with C++ tools for example). Then you can run `build.bat`, and find the output in `NV-Derevo/release`.

~~Or you can get a ready to use version in the Releases tab. Just load `Derevo.cfg` into your RLBotGUI.~~
